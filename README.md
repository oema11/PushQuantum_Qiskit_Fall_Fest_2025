# PushQuantum_Qiskit_Fall_Fest_2025

We host here the Notebooks for the Qiskit Fall Fest 2025 hosted by PushQuantum.

First of all thanks for your participation. If you want to ask any questions regarding any of these notebooks please join the Discord in the Email you got for the event. 

Other than that, there is no real Todo. The easiest way to start is by cloning this repository and then trying the Challenges. In many cases there is no right or wrong answer. 

We plan these notebooks to be a bit deeper then the small introduction at the beginning of the Fall Fest. There is no specific order in which you need to do these notebooks or anything. Just take your time and learn how qiskit works and how to work with a quantum computer.

However one order could be to start with the Module-1-Circuits_Backends notebook then go to the Translation notebook and finally do the Qiskit Challenge 2025 notebook.

For Challenge submission fork the repository and make your chances. The fork should be public otherwise we cannot find it :D 

Please have fun learning and taking your time with Qiskit. Consider this Fall Fest not like a crazy challenge but more as a introduction in quantum computing and quantum compiling.

Please keep in mind that we are just learning like you do and do all this stuff on a volunteering basis, so you can expect that some things break, are not clear or straight up don't work. However we will try our best to let you have a nice exprience.
